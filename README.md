# Canadian-News-Provinces-Analysis

The provided Python script performs several tasks related to web scraping and text analysis. It extracts information from two different URLs, specifically from the CBC News website and the Windspeaker platform.

For the CBC News website, it counts the mentions of various Canadian provinces and territories in the headlines and prints the results in a grid format, comparing the counts between CBC News and Windspeaker, and then providing the total counts.

For the Windspeaker platform, it extracts the text from the body of the page, cleans the text by removing HTML tags and common prepositions, builds a frequency dictionary of words, and identifies the top ten most frequent topics. Finally, it prints out these top topics along with the number of instances they appear in the text.

Overall, the script demonstrates the extraction of information from web pages, text cleaning, frequency analysis, and reporting of results, providing insights into the content of news articles from these sources.
